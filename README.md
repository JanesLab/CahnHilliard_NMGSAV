# CahnHilliard_NMGSAV
Nonlinear multigrid and Scalar auxiliary variable solvers of the Cahn-Hilliard equation

Options for NMG and SAV solvers in MATLAB, Julia, and Python. The Python implementation of NMG is not recommended due to long runtime.

Examples of how to run the code can be found in each subfolder as run_spinodal_decomp_tutorial, which corresponds to Figures 1 and 2 in Groves, Lu, et al. (BioRxiv).

Note that the Python and Julia versions of this code is subject to change upon packaging.
